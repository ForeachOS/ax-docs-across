=== Getting started
The reference documentation is split up into several parts:

* link:section-whats-new.adoc[What's new in this version] lists the release notes of the Across framework
* link:fundamentals/index.adoc#fundamentals[Fundamentals] explains the fundamental concepts of Across, things you should really understand when building Across applications or modules
* link:developing-applications/index.adoc[Developing Across applications] goes into some more detail about the steps involved in developing application with Across modules, as well as some of the features you can use
* link:developing-modules/index.adoc[Developing Across modules] is more geared towards developers interested in creating shared modules - although the information is generally useful
* link:across-web-module/index.adoc[AcrossWebModule] gives an overview of the web specific additions that Across core brings
* link:testing/index.adoc[Testing] explains how developers can integration test their modules or applications

Through the {{ book.across_url }}[Across website] you can find a lot more information like frequently asked questions, tutorials and available modules (with their respective documentation).
