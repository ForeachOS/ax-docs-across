This chapter explains the terminology and fundamental concepts involved with developing Across applications and modules.
Understanding these terms and concepts is a prerequisite for working with Across.

== Required knowledge
To be able to develop with Across, you need a good grasp of Java (8) and Spring Framework.
Spring MVC experience is strongly advised, and some Spring Boot knowledge might be helpful.

At the very least you should be familiar with Springâ€™s approach for dependency injection, the `ApplicationContext` and java-based configuration.

Other commonly used libraries that are useful to know are http://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate], http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data], http://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] and http://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf].

=== Across and Spring framework
{spring-url}[Spring framework] is a de facto industry standard for building Java (web) applications.
It was a logical choice to use it as the foundation for Across.
Across extends or even customizes some aspects of Spring, but still supports most if not all common Spring functions out of the box.
To optimally use Across, a good knowledge of Spring is required.

Across is primarily built on top of Spring framework, but also includes some https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] dependencies.
Some features of Spring Boot are being used but an Across application is structured differently from a regular Spring Boot application, and as such compatibility is limited.
Most notable is the fact auto-configuration using Spring Boot starters is not supported.

Other modules often integrate different packages from the Spring ecosystem.
In the <<across-standard-modules,standard modules>> for example, there are modules building on top of {spring-data-url}[Spring Data], {spring-batch-url}[Spring Batch] and {spring-security-url}[Spring security].

== Across Framework
Across Framework is the actual Java library providing all the infrastructure necessary to build Across modules and to run applications based on them.

[[across-platform]]
== Across Platform
Across Platform is a set of curated dependencies and Across modules that play well together and help developers assemble applications.
It is provided as a bill-of-material POM, extending the Spring IO platform BOM.

Across applications usually use the Across Platform BOM as a basis, to ensure that both third-party libraries as well as common Across modules are compatible.

[[across-standard-modules]]
== Across Standard Modules
Apart from the Across framework itself, there is a set of Across Standard Modules.
These modules are usually maintained by the Across core team.
They provide a common set of functionality that can be used as the foundation for your application.

There are standard modules that provide you with the set-up for an administrative web interface, secured with {spring-security-url}[Spring security] and built on top of an entire roles and permissions management domain layer.
Other modules generate web forms at runtime for persistent entities you have declared in your application.

Across framework provides only a ground layer, the real win is in re-using well-defined modules that have already been built.
The standard modules projects aims to do exactly that: bring some generic base modules to the open source Across landscape.
