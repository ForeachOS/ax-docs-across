== Across datasource
An Across context supports the configuration of a `DataSource` instance.
If there is a primary `DataSource` or only a single `DataSource` bean available, Across will automatically use that one.

The datasource will be available for all modules as bean named *acrossDataSource*.
Additionally a second datasource can be configured that will be available as the *acrossInstallerDataSource*.
If no separate installer datasource is specified, the default across datasource will be used.

.Installers
Across only actually needs a datasource if you want to execute installers or use the `DistributedLockRepository` directly.
The datasource is used for keeping track of which installers have been executed.
