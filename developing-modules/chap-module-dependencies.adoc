== Module dependencies

There are several ways to influence the beans that are being bootstrapped with a module, by passing information from the configuration to the actual module ApplicationContext.

=== @AcrossDepends

==== Using @AcrossDepends on a module

Using AcrossDepends annotation on a component class you can avoid beans or Configurations from being created based on the presence of other modules.
required modules: the component will only be created if all required modules are present
optional modules: the component will only be created if at least one of the optional modules is present

==== Using @AcrossDepends on component classes
expression will be evaluated against the module context - as usual - beans from earlier modules will be available

=== Conditionals
Any Spring conditional can be used to determine of a bean should be created.
