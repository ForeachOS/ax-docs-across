=== Module resolving
By default modules are resolved using a `ClassPathScanningModuleDependencyResolver`.
If a module can't be resolved the reason is usually one of the following:

* the package containing the module has not been added for module scanning
* there is no `public static final String NAME` field containing the unique module name
* there is no public constructor without parameters

You can configure more verbose logging by setting the logger level for `com.foreach.across.core.context.ClassPathScanningCandidateModuleProvider` to `TRACE`.
This will output all candidate modules that have been considered during scanning.
