== TODO: Across datasource
An AcrossContext supports the configuration of a DataSource instance.
The datasource will be available for all modules as bean named *acrossDataSource*.
Additionally a second datasource can be configured that will be available as the *acrossInstallerDataSource*.
If no separate installer datasource is specified, the default across datasource will be used.

TODO: if you want to run installers, you need a datasource (distributedlock repository, installer tracking)
