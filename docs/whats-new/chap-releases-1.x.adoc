=== 1.1.2.RELEASE
*Across Core*

Across now requires JDK8 and has improved support for Spring Boot.
The latter is also a required dependency as of 1.1.2.
A lot of improvements have been done to reduce the amount of boilerplate code necessary to create a new `AcrossContext`.

* link:developing-applications/index.adoc#enable-across-context[@EnableAcrossContext] annotation now supports autoconfiguration of an `AcrossContext`
* link:developing-modules/index.adoc#module-configuration[@ModuleConfiguration] annotation provides a no-hassle way to declare annotated classes that need to be added to a specific module
* message sources are now link:developing-modules/index.adoc#auto-detecting-message-sources[auto detected] if they follow the conventions
* both `AcrossModule` and `ModuleBootstrapConfig` now have shortcut `expose()` methods that make it easier to expose additional beans
* several changes and improvements were made to installers:
** installers are now created in their own configurable link:developing-modules/index.adoc#installer-applicationcontext[installer `ApplicationContext`]
** installers are detected automatically through classpath scanning (defaults to *installers* package of a module)
** installers are ordered based on the presence of an `@Order` annotation
** installers now support `@Conditional` annotations for building more complex conditions
** installers should only be specified as class names in `getInstallers()`, the use of instances is deprecated
** `InstallerSettings` has been refactored to use `InstallerMetaData` instead (breaking change)
** installers can implement `InstallerActionResolver` directly to suppress execution at runtime
** `AcrossInstallerRepository` now has methods to rename installers
** `AcrossLiquibaseInstaller` detects the most appropriate `SchemaConfiguration` to use and modifies default schema accordingly
* development mode can be set through the property *across.development.active* and is active by default if a Spring profile called *dev* is active

*AcrossWebModule*

* link:developing-applications/index.adoc#across-application[@AcrossApplication] can be used with `SpringApplication` to bootstrap an Across context with dynamic modules and support for embedded servlet containers
* async configuration can now correctly be set through `WebMvcConfigurer#configureAsyncSupport(AsyncSupportConfigurer)`
* `AcrossWebModuleSettings` has been refactored and `AcrossWebModule` can now be link:across-web-module/index.adoc#module-settings[configured through properties]
** properties support Spring configuration metadata with possible IDE support
* by default only Thymeleaf views support is activated (breaking change)
* static resources now configure default link:across-web-module/index.adoc#client-side-caching[client-side caching] and link:across-web-module/index.adoc#resource-url-versioning[resource url versioning]
* link:across-web-module/index.adoc#registering-servlets-and-filters[dynamic registration of servlets and filters] now supports ordering
* link:across-web-module/index.adoc#default-http-encoding[Default HTTP encoding] is now forced to UTF-8

*Across Test*

Several improvements have been done for easier integration testing of modules in a web context.

* link:testing/index.adoc#test-context-builders[test context builders] have been added for easy configuration of an `AcrossContext` in test methods
* link:testing/index.adoc#mock-across-servlet-contex[MockAcrossServletContext] can now be used for testing of dynamic `ServletContext` configuration
* addition of a `AcrossMockMvcBuilders` class for creating a `MockMvcBuilder` based on an `AcrossContext`
** both link:testing/index.adoc#annotations[annotations] and link:testing/index.adoc#test-context-builders[test builders] now provide a singleton `MockMvc` instance that is initialized with the bootstrapped context and all dynamically registered filters
