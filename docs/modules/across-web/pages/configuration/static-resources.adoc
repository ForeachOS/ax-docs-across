[#static-resources]
== Static resources
Across Web automatically enables serving of static resources bundled with modules.
With the default settings static resources will be configured with <<resource-url-versioning,versioned urls>> and <<client-side-caching,client-side caching>>.

[[static-resources-conventions]]
[#conventions]
=== Conventions
The default resources are served from the */views* folder on the classpath.
By default AcrossWebModule will serve resources from _/views/static_.
Additional subfolders can be configured with the *acrossWebModule.resources.folders* property.

By convention (and for best development mode support) module specific resources should be located in a subfolder with the `resourcesKey` of the module.

.Example resources layout for MyModule
[source,text,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
src/main/resources
   views/
     static/
       MyModule/
         js/controller.js
         css/my-module.css
         img/logo.png
     th/
       MyModule/
         controller.html
         user-profile.html
----

The relative path under which the static resources are available is determined by the *acrossWebModule.resources.path* property.

[[client-side-caching]]
[#client-side-caching]
=== Client-side caching
By default static resources will be cached on the client-side for a period of 1 year.
Disabling client-side caching is done with the *acrossWebModule.resources.caching.enabled* property.
If client-side caching is disabled, no cache headers will be sent to the client.

Configuring the caching period is done separately with the *acrossWebModule.resources.caching.period* property.
Setting the value to *0* with caching enabled will sent *no-cache* headers.
This is also the default if development mode is active.

[[resource-url-versioning]]
[#resource-url-versioning]
=== Resource URL versioning
//TODO fix spring link to mvc config static resources
By default AcrossWebModule enables link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-config-static-resources[Spring versioning of static resources].
This will generate versioned URLs, create a `ResourceUrlProvider` bean and add a `ResourceUrlEncodingFilter` and `ResourceUrlProviderExposingInterceptor` to the request handlers.

Using versioned resource URLs is transparent:

* in Thymeleaf all relative links added with `@{/relative/path}` will be rewritten if necessary
* in JSP the equivalent is the `<spring:url value="/relative/path" var="url"/>` tag

Using these will work both with or without resource versioning.

WARNING: If versioning is disabled, the `ResourceUrlProvider` will not be available on the request.
Modules using accessing the `ResourceUrlProvider` directly should built-in support for this.

==== Fixed version strategy
AcrossWebModule supports automatic configuration of resource versioning using a single fixed version.
When enabled this means that resources of the form */across/resources/static/mymodule/mymodule.css* will get rewritten to */across/resources/static/VERSION/mymodule/mymodule.css*.

The fixed version used is determined as follows:

. *acrossWebModule.resources.versioning.version* property
. *build.number* property
. version of the AcrossWebModule

Using the fixed version strategy works well for relative includes in both CSS and JS files, avoiding the need to rewrite URLs inside those files.

==== Customizing the version strategy
It is possible to keep configuration of the default resources active but only change the version strategy used.
This can be done by injecting your own `VersionResourceResolver` bean named *versionResourceResolver* the AcrossWebModule context.

.Example providing custom version strategy
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
@ModuleConfiguration(AcrossWebModule.NAME)
public static class CustomVersionResourceResolver
{
	@Bean
	public VersionResourceResolver versionResourceResolver() {
		return new VersionResourceResolver()
				.addVersionStrategy( new FixedVersionStrategy( "1.0" ), "/**/*.css" )
				.addVersionStrategy( new FixedVersionStrategy( "2.0" ), "/**" );
	}
}
----

NOTE: Because of limitations of the `CssLinkTransformer` in combination with a fixed version strategy, AcrossWebModule does not rewrite links inside css files.
If you absolutely need this in your application, you will have to disable the automatic resource versioning and configure it yourself.
