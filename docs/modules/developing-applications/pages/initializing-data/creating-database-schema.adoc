* [*] How to create a database schema

== Creating a database schema

One of the most common use cases for installers is to create database schemas.
Let's start of with a simple example where we create a simple database table using liquibase.

To do so, we'll start by creating an xml file in which we use a liquibase database changelog to create a table.
The xml file should be placed in the resources directory of the project.
As good practice, it is advised to place it in a directory named *installers/{application-artifact}*, with a naming strategy based on your application to prevent possible name conflicts or overwrites.

.Example liquibase database changelog
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<databaseChangeLog
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog
         http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.1.xsd">

	<property name="table.user" value="table_user"/> # <1>

	<changeSet id="201805231424" author="stg"> # <2>
		<preConditions onFail="MARK_RAN"> # <3>
			<not>
				<tableExists tableName="${table.user}"/>
			</not>
		</preConditions>

		<comment>Creates user table</comment> # <4>

		<createTable tableName="${table.user}"> # <5>
			<column name="id" type="java.sql.Types.BIGINT">
				<constraints nullable="false" primaryKey="true" primaryKeyName="pk_tbl_user"/>
			</column>
			<column name="first_name" type="java.sql.Types.NVARCHAR(255)">
			    <constraints nullable="false"/>
			</column>
			<column name="last_name" type="java.sql.Types.NVARCHAR(255)">
                <constraints nullable="false"/>
            </column>
			<column name="email" type="java.sql.Types.NVARCHAR(255)">
				<constraints nullable="false"/>
			</column>
			<column name="date_of_birth" type="java.sql.Types.DATE"/>
			<column name="phone_number" type="java.sql.Types.NVARCHAR(255)"/>
		</createTable>
	</changeSet>
</databaseChangeLog>
```
<1> Definition of global properties to be used within the changesets.
Properties are replaced by their value during execution.
<2> A changeset is defined.
Changesets always require a unique identifier (`id`) and an author.
<3> Preconditions are defined as to when the changeset should be executed.
In this example, we check for the existence of the table we are going to create.
Should the table exist, then it does not have to be created and this changeset may be marked as ran.
<4> Optionally, a comment can be added to further describe which changes are performed.
<5> A create table statement is defined.

Through the use of an installer, we can now execute the aforementioned liquibase script when the application is started.
Take a look the link:https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html[liquibase documentation] to learn more about its features.

We've got our database changelog, now we still need to execute it.
Let's add an installer to the project which will execute the changesets found in the aforementioned xml file.
As installers are a special type of bean that should only exist during the startup phases of our application, we want to make sure that those beans do not get created automatically.
To ensure that, we'll add them to the `installers` package within our `application` package, which is scanned by Across for installer beans.

NOTE: The `installers` package is one of the special packages that is not scanned automatically for any type of beans.
It is however, specifically scanned to create `Installer` beans during the application startup phases.

.Example database schema installer
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Order(1) # <1>
@Installer(name = "schema-installer", runCondition = InstallerRunCondition.VersionDifferent, description = "Installs the required database tables", version = 1) # <2>
public class SchemaInstaller extends AcrossLiquibaseInstaller # <3>
{
	public SchemaInstaller() {
		super( "classpath:installers/demo/schema/DemoSchemaInstaller.xml" ); # <4>
	}
}
----
<1> Installers are executed in the order they are picked up.
An explicit ordering can be defined using the `@Order` annotation.
<2> The `@Installer` annotation is present and various parameters are defined.
This means that it can be found by Across and executed during one of the startup phases.
The `runCondition` parameter defines whether the installer should *always* be executed, or only *when necessary* (e.g. through versioning).
The version parameter defaults to `1`, as such, it is not required to provide the parameter, unless you want/have increased the version of the installer before.
<3> For ease of use, a `AcrossLiquibaseInstaller` class has been defined.
This is a base class for Installers to execute liquibase database changelog scripts based on a given xml file.
<4> Define the path to the xml file that contains the liquibase changelog script.

Whilst the application is being started, the installer is automatically picked up by across and executed.

<1> The schema installer is executed.

This can also quickly be checked through the h2-console, where our newly created table can be found.
In addition to the `table_user`, other tables have been created as well, which were created by the core schema.

Installer execution is tracked to ensure that installers are only run if they have not yet been executed, which is specified through the `runCondition` and `version` parameters.
Tracking is done by the `AcrossInstallerRepository`, which can also be wired as a bean in installers.
This could be helpful in migration trajectories for example to rename installers.

Aside of tracking, execution is also synchronized for when multiple applications would connect to the same database through the use of a `DistributedLockRepository` that is created in the core schema.
The `DistributedLockRepository` provides a simple locking mechanism for RDBMS synchronization.
A lock will be taken on the database as soon as a single installer wishes to execute, and will be released once that installer has finished executing.
The lock owner will contain the hostname of the computer running the application, as well as the displayName of the AcrossContext.

WARNING: Because of tracking and synchronization, a datasource is required in order to execute installers.
This is because the `DistributedLockRepository` relies on tables created in the core schema.
