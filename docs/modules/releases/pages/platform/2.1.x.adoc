= Across Platform 2.1.x release notes
:across-platform-current-release: 2.1.5

NOTE: Across Platform 2.1.x is the last series to provide the separate Platform BOM that projects should use.
As of the 5.x series projects should use one of xref:releases/index.adoc[the newer artifacts].

== Version overview

Select the specific platform version:

include::{partialsdir}/releases-2.1.x.adoc[]

== Using the Platform BOM

Using the BOM can be done by including it in the `dependencyManagement` section of your Maven build file.
Dependencies known in the platform BOM do not need a version element to be specified.
If a version is omitted, the version from the BOM will be used.
