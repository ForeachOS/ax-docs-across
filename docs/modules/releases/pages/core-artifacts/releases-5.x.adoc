= 5.x release notes

[#5-0-0]
== 5.0.0.RELEASE

=== Core dependency upgrades

* Spring Framework 5.1.9
* Spring Boot 2.1.7

=== Across Core

* `across.configuration` has been dropped in favour of `across-configuration.yml` which allows more advanced configuration
* several deprecated classes have been removed: `HasSchemaConfiguration`

=== Across Web

* The standard `ViewElement` and `ViewElementBuilder` have been refactored
//** `ViewElement` methods are chainable by default
//** custom implementations should use one of the 3 base classes to ensure chainability: `AbstractContainerViewElement`, `AbstractNodeViewElement` or `AbstractVoidNodeViewElement`
//** a `ViewElement` for a HTML5 tag can be created using the factory methods on `HtmlViewElements`
//** due this refactoring a `NodeViewElement` is no longer a `ContainerViewElement` (but an `AbstractContainerViewElement`), code should be adjusted accordingly
* several deprecated classes have been removed: `AcrossDynamicServletConfigurer`
