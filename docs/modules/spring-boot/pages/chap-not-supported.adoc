== Not supported
The following is a list of common auto-configuration classes that are not automatically enabled, but explicitly excluded instead.
They are not added to the application configuration and none of the standard modules include them.

In some cases, these can still be added directly using an `@Import` statement inside an application or module.
When doing so however, you should be aware of possible conflicts with other Across features.

`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.liquibase.LiquibaseAutoConfiguration`::
Across always packages Liquibase but uses installers instead of a default changeset xml.
Looks like the auto-configuration breaks in this case.

`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.thymeleaf.ThymeleafAutoConfiguration`::
AcrossWebModule provides its own Thymeleaf configuration that differs slightly from the Spring Boot default.
Templates are expected to be in `classpath:/views/*` with `html` extension.

`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.context.MessageSourceAutoConfiguration`::
  Across has its own message source mechanism for modules.
  The default Spring Boot message sources - configurable using `spring.messages` properties - are not supported by default.
