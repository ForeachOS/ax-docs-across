== Not supported
The following is a list of common auto-configuration classes that are never automatically enabled.
They are not added to the application configuration and none of the standard modules include them.

In many cases, these can still be added directly using an `@Import` statement inside an application or module.

`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.liquibase.LiquibaseAutoConfiguration`::
Across always packages Liquibase but uses installers instead of a default changeset xml.
Looks like the auto-configuration breaks in this case.

`org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.thymeleaf.ThymeleafAutoConfiguration`::
AcrossWebModule provides its own Thymeleaf configuration that differs slightly from the Spring Boot default.
Templates are expected to be in `classpath:/views/*` with `html` extension.
