|Event type |Description

|`AcrossModuleBeforeBootstrapEvent`
|Event that is sent right before the module is bootstrapped.
The configuration of the module can still be modified at this point.

|`AcrossModuleBootstrappedEvent`
|Event published when a module has bootstrapped.
That means the module itself has started, but installers attached to the `AfterModuleBootstrap` phase have not yet been executed.

|`AcrossContextBootstrappedEvent`
|Event published after the AcrossContext has bootstrapped.
That means full initialization has happened: all modules are started and all installers have been executed.
