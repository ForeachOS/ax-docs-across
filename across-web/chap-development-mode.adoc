== Development mode support
{module-name} supports development mode retrieval of physical resources.
If the conventions for static resources and Thymeleaf templates were followed, these will be fetched automatically from their physical location.
This ensures that an application restart is not required for static resources or Thymeleaf rendering.

If development mode is active {module-name} will also send no-cache headers for static resources and will use a generated fixed version if versioning is enabled.
