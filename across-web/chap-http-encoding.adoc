[[default-http-encoding]]
== Default HTTP encoding
{module-name} registers a default `CharacterEncodingFilter` that forces the request and response encoding to use UTF-8.
This is done through the `HttpEncodingAutoConfiguration` from Spring Boot and can be controlled with the following properties:

* spring.http.encoding.enabled
* spring.http.encoding.charset
* spring.http.encoding.force

If a `CharacterEncodingFilter` bean is found in the parent `ApplicationContext` but default HTTP encoding is enabled, {module-name} will take care of registering that filter bean.
