[[menu-building]]
== Building menus
{module-name} provides some infrastructure to build a tree-like menu.
The output class is a `Menu` instance that is created by the `MenuFactory` service.
When building a menu, a `BuildMenuEvent` is published with the menu instance, the name of the menu will be the name of the event.
The `BuildMenuEvent` provides access to a `PathBasedMenuBuilder` that allows asynchronous registering of menu items with a unique hierarchical path.
After the event handling the actual menu will be built and path structure will be used for the tree hierarchy.
